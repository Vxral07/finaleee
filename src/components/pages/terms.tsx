                    <p>Some other important details about the Terms of Use:</p><br />
                    <p>In the event that any provision in these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. You may not assign this Terms of Use (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Nuqi, and any prohibited assignment will be null and void.</p><br />
                    <p>Nuqi may assign this Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. The relationship of the parties under these Terms of Use is that of independent contractors, and these Terms of Use will not be construed to imply that either party is the agent, employee, or joint venture of the other. Note that if you elect to become a Client, the relationship of the parties will be governed by these Terms of Use, Client Agreement, our Privacy Policy and any additional terms to which you agree when you create and fund an investment account.</p><br />
                    <p>We may make changes to this Terms of Use and the Service from time to time. We may do this for various reasons, including to reflect changes in or requirements of the applicable law, new features, or changes in business practices.</p><br />
                    <p>The latest version of this Terms of Use will be posted on the website under Terms of Use, and you should regularly check for the latest version. The newest version is the version that applies. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, you agree to the revised Terms of Use. You agree that this Terms of Use shall supersede any prior agreements (except as specifically stated herein) and shall govern your entire relationship with Nuqi, including but not limited to events, agreements, and conduct preceding your acceptance of this Terms of Use. We reserve the right to change this Terms of Use by posting a revised Terms of Use and we agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you don&apos;t agree with these changes, you must stop using Nuqi.</p><br />
                    <p>You agree the only way to provide us legal notice is at the address provided in Section 10.3.</p><br />
                    <p>9. International Use</p><br />
                    <p>Nuqi does not make any representation that its services are appropriate or available for use outside the DIFC. Similarly, we make no representations that accessing Nuqi from locations outside the DIFC is legal or permissible under local laws. If you access Nuqi from areas outside of the DIFC, you do so at your own risk and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws.</p><br />
